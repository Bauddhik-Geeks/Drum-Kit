# Drum-Kit

Drum kit is a beginner friendly project that allows you to play drums on the browser.

It has a number of keys on the webpage representing different drums in a typical drum set. 

When you click on any of the keys, youâ€™ll get the corresponding sound of the drum. And you can press them as many times as you want.
